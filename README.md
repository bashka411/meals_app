## Acknowledgements
- This app was built while following along with the ["Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) course by Academind on Udemy, but it has since been heavily modified and reimagined in my own way.
